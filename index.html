    <!-- Hi, I'm Robert! I'm a Computer Science major. It's my third year of college, and my second year at Georgia Tech. I'm from upstate New York (Hudson Valley); my freshman year was spent at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before I transferred here. In high school, I was a founding member of the robotics club, where part of our time was spent teaching younger students to program using hands-on activities. I love taking pictures and playing competitive (guideline) Tetris. -->
