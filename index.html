                            Hi, I'm Robert!
                        </span>
                        <span>
                            I'm a Computer Science major;
                        </span>
                        <span>
                            it's my third year of college, and my second year at Georgia Tech.
                        </span>
                        <span>
                            I'm from upstate New York (Hudson Valley); my freshman year was spent at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before I transferred here.

                        <span>
                            With my high school FTC robotics team, I volunteered to help coach Jr. FLL and FLL teams in our school district, and hosted workshops teaching Arduino, CAD, and programming mBots.

                        <span>
                            I love taking pictures and playing competitive (guideline) Tetris.
